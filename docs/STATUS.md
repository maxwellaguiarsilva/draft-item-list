# Project Status Summary

## Current Phase: Phase 3 (List Management UI) - IMPROVED
The project has undergone a significant refactoring to address previous logic and consistency issues.

### Completed Tasks
- **Phase 1 (Foundation):**
    - Environment initialization (Next.js 16.1.6, TypeScript).
    - Local PostgreSQL database setup via Docker Compose.
    - Data modeling (User, List, Group, Item) implemented in `schema.prisma`.
    - Initial database migration completed.
- **Phase 2 (Authentication):**
    - Configured `Auth.js` with Google Provider.
    - Updated `schema.prisma` with mandatory Auth.js models.
- **Phase 3 (List Management UI & Core Logic):**
    - **Security:** Implemented `userId` validation in all Service layers and Actions.
    - **Business Logic:** Implemented **Recursive Deep Cloning** for Lists, Groups, and Items.
    - **Recursion:** Refactored `listService.getListDetails` to build the tree in memory, supporting infinite nesting depth.
    - **Onboarding:** Added automatic creation of a default "My First List" for new users.
    - **Categorização:** `ListForm` now includes a `datalist` to select existing categories or create new ones.
    - **Contadores de Quantidade:** Implemented `+` and `-` buttons in `ItemView` with a minimum value of 1.
    - **Edit Mode:** Implemented hover-based menus for all entities (List, Group, Item) supporting Rename, Duplicate, Reorder (Move Up/Down), and Delete.
    - **Reorder Logic for Lists:** Added `position` field to `List` model and implemented reordering in the Sidebar with "Move Up" and "Move Down" support.
    - **Testing:** Integrated **Vitest** and added unit tests for `list.service.ts` validating tree construction, deep cloning, and position management.
    - **Code Quality:** Refactored UI components (`ListDetailView`, `Sidebar`, `ListForm`) to use proper TypeScript interfaces, removing `any` types and improving type safety. Resolved major linting issues.
    - **Vanilla CSS:** Maintained 100% compliance with custom CSS variables and dark mode.

### Current Status
- Authentication, List management, and recursive data structures are fully functional, tested, and secure.
- UI is highly interactive with hover-based edit modes and intuitive quantity controls.
- Onboarding flow ensures new users have immediate access to list management.

### Next Steps
1. **Frontend Testing:** Add UI tests for components using `@testing-library/react`.
2. **Mobile Optimization:** Further refine "Edit Mode" for mobile devices (long-press support).
3. **Mixed-Type Reordering:** Refactor `ListDetailView` to support reordering between Items and Groups seamlessly.
